    </h2>
    <p>
      The BIO5 Institute connects and mobilizes hundreds of world-class plant, animal, and human bioscientists,
      engineers, physicians, and computational researchers to develop creative solutions for complex challenges such as
      disease, hunger, water and food safety, and other health issues facing Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interdisciplinary approach has resulted in improved food crops, innovative diagnostics and devices, disease
      prevention strategies, and promising new therapies.
    </p>
    <p>
      BIO5 initiatives and projects are carefully chosen to align with areas of state and national need and for which
      University of Arizona faculty already have significant expertise. This strategy catalyzes the capacity to expand
      impact, economic opportunity and external funding opportunities.
