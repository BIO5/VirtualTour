<p>Emmi Whitehorse</p>
<p>About the Artist </p>
<p></p> Born in New Mexico on the Navajo Reservation, Emmi Whitehorse and her family herded sheep and traveled between winter and summer pastures. She attended the University of New Mexico and earned a Master of Fine Arts. Ms. Whitehorse feels fortunate that she can devote all of her time to creating art and showing it here and abroad in private, museum, gallery, and governmental collections. She hopes to continue working in good health.</p>
<p>In the Artistâ€™s Words </p>
<p> These works are done with chalk, oil bars, and small oil pastel sticks. Water Cure is on four large wood panels, while Salmon Berry is paper mounted on canvas, as are the majority of my works. I was trained as a print maker, so paper is my favorite material on which to work. </p>
<p>As a young person, I grew up with miles of space and spent summers tending the large herds of sheep that my grandmother cultivated. Spending so much time out in the open, I learned the art of observation, which is an important part of my process. My work has always been about the observance of nature, landscape, the color of time, and the chaotic rearranging of wind, light and the other elements. My job is to transform this seemingly chaotic information into order, into a balance of harmony in accordance with Navajo philosophy. All this activity recorded in the color, light and activity of the circles, lines and ciphers of my work, creating an abstracted vocabulary. </p>
