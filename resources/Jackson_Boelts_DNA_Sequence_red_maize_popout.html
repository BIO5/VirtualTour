                <p>About the Artist </p>
                <p> Jackson Boelts has been an educator, designer and artist for more than 25 years, and has won more
                    than 500 awards for his art and design work. His work is exhibited in Moscow, Mexico, Poland,
                    Germany, and numerous locations nationally. As a full professor of art at the University of Arizona,
                    Mr. Boelts’ love and mastery of teaching is evident in his network of thousands of accomplished
                    graduates around the globe.</p>
                <p>In the Artist’s Words </p>
                <p> Creating landscapes that integrate digital code into photography and traditional media was the focus
                    of Maize Sequence. Inspired by abstract expressionist Adof Gottlieb’s painting of the 1950’s this
                    series of works juxtaposes a digitally printed rectangle with a hand-painted circle. The contrast
                    illuminates more than just the visual artistic elements of the piece- it also speaks to the vast
                    gulf that lies between simple biological entities and our technological view of them.</p>
                <p>A layered photographic image if an organism with its typographical DNA sequence (A, G, C, T), along
                    with an abstract sphere, are used to create a pictorial landscape. In this series, images of grass;
                    cotton; and red, yellow and blue maize are used as a background in the landscapes. Upon close
                    inspection, the actual DNA sequence for that particular organism is seen subtly integrated with the
                    photograph. A fiery circle symbolizing the life-giving forces of the sun completes the image. The
                    molecule we know as the basic building block of life - (A) adenine, and (G) guanine, ( C) cytosine,
                    and (T) thymine - are used as a symbolic visual identifier in these works.</p>
