                <p> About the Artist </p>
                <p> Barbara Rogers has exhibited nationally and internationally, including one- person exhibitions at
                    major galleries and museums in San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Scottsdale,
                    Germany, and the United Arab Emirates. Her work is in major public and private collections including
                    The San Francisco Museum of Art, The San Jose Museum of Art, and the ASU Museum. </p>
                <p>Ms. Rogers sees the importance of the garden as a fundamental pivot where nature and culture can
                    convene and where personal desires can assume political significance. </p>
                <p>Ms. Rogers holds a degree from Ohio State University and the University of California at Berkeley.
                    She joined the faculty of the School of Art at the University of Arizona in 1990. </p>
                <p>In the Artistâ€™s Words </p>
                <p> This former ocean bottom that we call the Sonoran Desert has life forms more beautiful, relevant,
                    and astonishing than any artist could ever create. The sun, winds, water, along with all the natural
                    elements, shape the mysterious tales of survival of life in this tough little paradise. Ordinary
                    Miracles: Life in the Desert is about the ever- evolving cast of characters and their dramatic
                    environment that I can see from my window and in my travels through the Sonoran Desert. This cast of
                    characters work so hard to stay alive. Each life is a miracle. Each life contributes something vital
                    to our ecosystem even if we do not understand its role. Through the use of forms, colors, and visual
                    symbols for the sun- all suggesting the ancient oceanic beginnings, the struggle to create and
                    maintain life, and the preciousness of water- the painting reflects my love for this inspiring
                    environment. I feel part of a group of people highly privileged to live here. </p>
