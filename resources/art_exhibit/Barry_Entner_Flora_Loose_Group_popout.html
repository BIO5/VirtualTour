                <p>For more than thirty five years, sculptor Barry Entner has been exploring the properties of glass in
                    the pursuit of his unique vision. Using a primarily tropical palette, Entner creates otherworldly
                    forms, reflecting the relationship between kinetic and potential life. The elegant and vital
                    movements inherent in his forms are the result of his innovative, vibrant designs. His work is shown
                    in museums, public spaces, and private collections throughout the world. </p>
                <p>Barry Entner works with designers, galleries, Architects and collectors throughout the world to
                    create unique sculptures, from pedestal pieces to site specific installations. </p>
                <p>Barry works personally with his clients from the earliest stages of design to the final completion of
                    each unique sculpture. The level of detail and care Barry puts into each of his sculptures firmly
                    inserts him into the upper echelon of todayâ€™s sculptural artists. In many cases, his pieces have
                    grown in value since their original purchase and have become a centerpiece for both conversation and
                    delight. </p>
