                <p>In the artist’s words </p>
                <p> In the past few years, personal computing and new technology have provided several tools that I have
                    adapted into my visual art-making process. My paintings journey through a metamorphosis and
                    synthesis of manipulates images that are printed with archival inks on watercolor papers to serve as
                    under paintings for further enchantment with traditional media. These second stage images are often
                    scanned again and reworked through electronic and traditional media.</p>
                <p>I am a collector of glass art and have enjoyed watching the formation of molten glass into original
                    works of art. In The Biomarble Series, I wanted to suggest a metamorphic or “bio” history that would
                    be expressive of a reproductive process that captures the swirling of color into a marble form. I
                    began by placing marbles onto my digital scanner and then manipulated these captured scans into a
                    composition through cropping, magnification, color enhancement, and electronically twirling shapes
                    in and out of them. I added watercolor washes; wax pencils and pastels for color variation, enhanced
                    contrast and highlight.</p>
